Lab created for computer science 3 lab. This lab was designed to teach you how to think recursively and introduce you to the depth first search algorithm.Write a recursive method that will solve the eight-queens problem using backtracking. Basically, there can only be one queen on each row, column and diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The easiest way to check if two queens are on the same diagonal is by Math.abs(row1-row2) == Math.abs(col1-col2). The graphics are done for you. Complete the solve() method recursively and the isValid() method. 
Lab finished on September 28th, 2023.
